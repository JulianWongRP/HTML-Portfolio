                <h4>
                    This design project was another one of my favourite pieces to work on for the module C257 Design Fundamentals. 
                    For this we simlpy had to use come up with a logo design using our name or initials as the logo name.

                <h3>DRAFTS</h3>
                <h4>
                    The first design draft was the little dragon in the corner curiously staring at the letter 'S'. if you're wondering why 
                    the 'S' looks like that, its because that is how 'S' looks in the written language of the 'How To Train Your Dragon' world,
                    I thought it would fit since the little dragon is toothless. I found some references online and it looked cute so I used it.
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    The second design draft is that card hanging from the cresent moon. For this draft I wanted to do a magic one to see how it would look
                    but using some regular hats and wands sounded a bit boring, so I went online and managed to find the card hanging from the moon 
                    and I used a deck with a ethereal fairies kind of feeling who are often depicted under moonlight, tieing in the moon nicely.
                    I changed the top and bottom corner into an 'S' like for the Aces and changed the center picture into a butterfly.

                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    The final design draft is actually a design I just randomly came up with during secondary school and it just stuck around,
                    the design uses the bolded letters as a brick wall, with the vines and roses intertwining between each letter. I came
                    up with this design when I was just drawing bold letters when I was bored then decided to just draw random patterns in the words, ended up
                    with a brick-like pattern, and drew the vines intertwining and finally added red roses because I thought it looked too 
                    plain with just a grey wall and green vines.

                <h3>FINAL</h3>
                <h4>For the final design I went with the 3rd one with the intertwining vines through the 'brick walls'.
                    Eventhough I love cute little dragon and the magic stuff, in terms of functionality, it would be 
                    very difficult to tell what company the first 2 are but if we ignore the functionality, I would 
                    definitely pick the dragon.
                </h4>
                <h4>Another reason is the feeling of nostalgia as I recall the days I spent drawing this design during
                    and after classes using my friends' names for it, as a gift for them. Including the times I got caught not paying attention . _. 
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    For the final colours, I initially wanted the same as back then with grey walls, green vines and red roses,
                    but when I coloured everything in, it looked like the 'message' I was trying to convey was within the vines 
                    with how much it stood out against the grey wall, since the wall looks slightly blended into the background.
                    So I switched it to another common brick colour which is this dusty red-orange kind of colour which feels 
                    very reminiscent of olden day victorian houses with overgrowth along the walls.

                <h4>I like how it turned out, it gave me an opportunity to enhance my previous designs 
                    even if it was just a little bit. If I have time I might try and turn the other 2 
                    drafts into illustrations just to see what it would look like and maybe I'll update 
                    this page and add them in when I do finish them.
