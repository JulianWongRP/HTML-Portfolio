                <h2>~~INTRODUCTION~~</h2>
                <h4>
                    This design project was one of my favourite pieces to work on for the module C257 Design Fundamentals. 
                    It features designing our name using typography, which is my favourite type of art to create. For this project,
                    we were suggested to follow a sentence, 'My name is ___, and I am a ___'. But my lecturer allowed us to just do the first half.

                <h3>DRAFTS</h3>
                <h4>
                    For the draft, the first design I thought of was actually a cat. The reason for this is because the spelling 
                    of my name is very close to that of a wild cat species called the Serval cat (Only reason I know this is cuz
                    of auto-correct on a new phone and I was wondering what in the world was that and searched it up) so I tried 
                    to write my name distorted to the shape of the cat which I think looks pretty cool for a first drawing. 
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    The second design I thought of was a Magic hat because I loved magic as a kid and also because I am in the 
                    school's magic club, Republic Magic. I also tried to write it distorted into the hat, looks really wonky though.
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    The final design I wanted to add in a dragon because I just love dragons so much, I was trying to find ways to 
                    distort my name into the shape of a dragon, but then I thought of just planting a dragon into the design of the name itself,
                    so I drew it as the 'S' and drew the other letters in a similar style to the dragon, adding small dragon elements at some places.

                <h3>MOOD BOARD</h3>
                <h4>
                    For the Mood Board I went with the dragon theme, a simple reason I chose them is that they're from 
                    my favorite shows and video games. Another reason I chose them was because of their colour palettes.

                <h4>
                    Gold is often associated with royalty in the real world with black as a common complimentary colour, 
                    this was shown in one of the games and movies where the gold dragon had a travelling companion
                    sporting a black colour scheme, and both having a position in the king's palace.
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    For black and purple combination, purple is sometimes seen as another colour for royalty, but it was 
                    mostly used to represent evil. In the same game and movie the travelling companion was a knight commander 
                    that was comsumed by greed, turning into a force of evil.

                <h3>FINAL</h3>
                <h4>
                    For the final design I decided to remove the horns from the letter 'E' to give it a cleaner look.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    I also added 3 different versions for the colours, each representing something different.
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    For the first set, I used a monochrome colour scheme with the colour teal. I chose teal as a mix of blue 
                    and green to represent water dragons, to me they symbolise the wisdom and serenity that some dragons possess.
                    So the shade I eventually went with is a bit paler than usual teal. 
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    For the second set, I used an analogous colour scheme with the colour red. Red fire Dragons are mostly
                    fierce and powerful beasts which to me symbolise the strength of dragons so it just made sense.
                </h4>
                <p class="spacer"></p>
                <h4>
                    The last set uses a complimentary colour scheme with the colour purple. Purple dragons are seen as the
                    evil and dangerous dragons and are usually the lightning dragons which is usually shown as white but in
                    this case we'll go with yellow.

                <h4>This is actually my first time doing this method of design as back then I usually did something simpler 
                    with much less thought put behind each step since I did it mostly for fun, but for the first time 
                    researching and designing this properly, I really like how it turned out.
